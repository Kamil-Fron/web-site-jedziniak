# Web Site Jedziniak

A simple static web site served using Node.js tools.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if you don't already have it.
2. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   (There are currently no dependencies, but this prepares `node_modules` if packages are added.)
3. Start a local server to view the site:
   ```bash
   npx http-server .
   ```
   Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
